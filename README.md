## 📖 Description

Fills the crates of the various structures in Minecraft with modified vanilla loot to find even more unique and special items!

----

- adds no new items and blocks! That means if you delete the mod later, you have still all custom items!
- vanilla items with their own name, lore, enchantments, attributes and components
- the loot spawns in many different structures, matching the theme
